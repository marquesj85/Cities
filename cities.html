  <h1>
  Top 3 cities I'd like to to visit
  </h1>
  <ol>
   <li><strong>Tokyo</strong></li>
   <li><em>New York</em></li>
   <li><strong>Chicago</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  I have always wanted to visit Tokyo because I am a huge anime fan. New York would be interesting because I have never been to such a big city. My dad was from Chicago so I have always wanted to see where he grew up.
